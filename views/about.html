                  Eric Sheridan Prydz (also known by his aliases Pryda, Tonja
                  Holma and Cirez D) is a Swedish DJ, record producer, and
                  musician. He rose to fame with his 2004 hit single "Call on

                  studio album, Opus. In 2017, he won DJ of the Year at the

                  Prydz is perhaps best known for his 2004 hit single "Call on
                  Me". It topped the UK singles chart for five weeks and was
                  number one on the German Top 100 for six consecutive weeks.
                  Although this track made him immensely popular, Prydz has
                  stopped playing it in his shows in an attempt to distance
                  himself from it. In some respects he has succeeded, and with
                  his newer songs, Prydz has gained recognition from both
                  underground and mainstream fans. In 2006, he released a
                  remixed version of Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall,
                  Part 2", titled "Proper Education". In 2008, Prydz released
                  the critically acclaimed single "Pjanoo", which topped the UK
                  Dance Chart. <br />
                  Together with Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello,
                  Prydz formed a group of DJs that informally referred to
                  themselves as the Swedish House Mafia. When the group with the
                  same name officially formed in late 2008, Prydz decided not to
                  join his friends. He has collaborated with Axwell under the
                  name Axer and with Angello as A&P Project.

                  In 2009, Prydz released "Miami to Atlanta", where the "Pryda
                  snare" was first used. The Pryda snare is a popular technique
                  in house and trance music consisting of using a compressed and
                  sustained snare sample at the end of a bar. Commonly used to
                  mark progressions in a song structure, it has been widely
                  sampled in the electronic dance music world, notably by
                  producers such as Martin Garrix, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike,
                  and W&W. On 21 May 2012, Prydz released his debut artist
                  album, Eric Prydz Presents Pryda, as a 3-disc album on Virgin
                  Records.
                  <br />
                  The Ministry of Sound club in London hosted the launch of Eric
                  Prydz Presents Pryda on 14 April 2012, where Prydz played some
                  of the tracks from the album. His 2013 Essential Mix was named
                  Essential Mix of the Year by Pete Tong.
                  <br />
                  2014 was the 10th year of Prydz's label “Pryda Recordings”,
                  and as a result, On 4 May 2015, Prydz announced PR(10)DA, a
                  collection of unreleased tracks from January 2004 to December
                  2014. PR(10)DA was released over three EPs, leading up to an
                  album release in February 2016.

                  On 19 May 2014, Prydz announced via social media the third
                  installment of his concert, Eric Prydz in Concert, titled EPIC
                  3.0. Promising the 'world's largest indoor hologram', new
                  music, and new visuals, the show was to be held at Madison
                  Square Garden during the Fall. Prydz performed his EPIC 3.0
                  show on 27 September 2014, playing a large range of new and
                  unreleased material. The show incorporated a 20m, 4K hologram,
                  and 32 lasers.
                  <br />

                  Music. On 5 February 2016, Prydz released his debut studio
